Switch Case:
    For any problem that has a descending order, use a switch case.
        Eg. grading system from 100 to 40, grades A - F.
        Here we first check the highest grade. If that is not satisfied, then check lower grades.
        Switch helps here as we can divide by 10, convert it to a 1-10 range value, and then start switch
            case from 10. Break if it is grade A, else keep going.
        Therefore: Use switch for descending order values
